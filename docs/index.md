# Motoko-lib

A library of Motoko modules that extend Motoko's base library.

The goal of this library is provide modules that are of high quality and ready to use in production. All package are, at a minimum, profiled for their cycle and memory consumption so that there are no surprises when using them. Some packages are also cycle-optimized.

See the "Modules" and "APIs" sections for a list of provided modules. 
The "APIs" contains the documentation that is extracted from the source code by `mo-doc`.
The "Modules" contains additional, more high-level information on each module that is not extracted from source code.
